# Procedural Room Dungeon Generator

It procedurally generates room dungeons. You can use this by simply adding an empty game object and add "RoomMapManager" component and put Map Prefab on that component. It generates when you play, and regenerate when you press space.

Any kinds of contributing will always be welcomed
