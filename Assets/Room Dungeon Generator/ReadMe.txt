Version 1.0



Instructions
------------
It procedurally generates room dungeons.
You can use this by simply adding an empty game object and add "RoomMapManager" component and put Map Prefab on that component. 
It generates one when you play, and regenerate one when you press space.

I'm going to keep upgrade this asset, so any kinds of contribution will always be welcomed. : https://github.com/Mids/Procedural-Room-Dungeon-Generator
